          <h3>Here's a time line of Christa McAuliffe's life:</h3>

          <p id="tribute-info">
            <ul id="info-list">
              <li><strong>1948 - </strong> Christa Corrigan was born on September 2, in Boston as the oldest of the five children of accountant Edward
                Christopher Corrigan (1922–1990), who was of Irish descent; and
                Grace Mary Corrigan (1924–2018; née George), a substitute teacher
              </li>
              <br><br>
              <li><strong>1966 - </strong>Graduated from Marian High School</li>
              <br><br>
              <li><strong>1970 - </strong>She married her longtime boyfriend whom she had known since high school, Steven J. McAuliffe,
                a 1970 graduate of the Virginia Military Institute,
                and they moved closer to Washington, D.C., so that he could attend the
                Georgetown University Law Center. They had two children, Scott and Caroline,
                who were nine and six, respectively, when she died.
              </li>
              <br><br>
              <li><strong>1970-1978 - </strong>She obtained her first teaching position in 1970, as an American history teacher
                at Benjamin Foulois Junior High School in Morningside, Maryland.
                 From 1971 to 1978, she taught history and civics at
                Thomas Johnson Middle School in Lanham, Maryland.
              </li>
              <br><br>
              <li><strong>1984 - </strong>, President Ronald Reagan announced the Teacher in Space Project, and
                Christa learned about NASA's efforts to find their first civilian,
                an educator, to fly into space. NASA wanted to find an "ordinary person,"
                a gifted teacher who could communicate with students while in orbit. McAuliffe became one of more
                than 11,000 applicants.
              </li>
              <br><br>
              <li><strong>1985 - </strong> July 1, she was announced as one of the 10 finalists, and on July 7 she traveled to
                Johnson Space Center for a week of thorough medical examinations and briefings about space flight.
              </li>
              <br><br>
              <li><strong>1986 - </strong>Later that year, McAuliffe and her backup Barbara Morgan each took a year-long leave of absence from teaching in order
                to train for a Space Shuttle mission. NASA paid both their salaries.
                While not a member of the NASA Astronaut Corps, McAuliffe was to be part of the STS-51-L crew,
                and would conduct experiments and teach lessons from space.
              </li>
              <br><br>
              <li><strong>1986 - </strong>On January 28, McAuliffe boarded Challenger with the other six crew members of STS-51-L.
                Seventy-three seconds into its flight at an altitude of 48,000 ft (14.630 km), the shuttle broke apart,
                resulting in the deaths of all seven crew members.
                According to NASA, it was in part because of the excitement over her presence on the shuttle that
                the accident had such a significant effect on the nation. Many schoolchildren were viewing the launch live,
                 and media coverage of the accident was extensive.
